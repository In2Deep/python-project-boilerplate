# IDE Governance Prompts

This directory contains agent governance rules for IDEs with built-in AI assistants.

- `rules.md`: Canonical governance rules to guide code changes and workflow.
- Usage: Point your IDE/agent to this file as the project prompt. Keep it in sync with your engineering practices.

Notes
- The rules enforce modern Python (3.13+) style, strict testing, task-driven commits, and a structured workflow.
- Adjust to your teamâ€™s preferences, but keep the spirit: quality gates, reproducibility, and traceability.
